# Jayda

## Automatic pattern library generator
(Work in progress)
Create pattern libraries automatically by just coding like you do everyday. No extra work or external files to keep up with.

Style-guide driven development the way it should be.

All templates are built using Jade.

Current Pattern showcases how do use this to create a pattern library based off of [http://materializecss.com/](http://materializecss.com/).

Do you need to use material design to use? Hell no. Just what I chose to use as filler.

You can use this to create fully customized pattern libraries... THAT IS THE POINT.

## Run
